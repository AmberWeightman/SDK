This workflow reads insurance data about multiple people from an excel file 
and for each person we enter the data on a website. After all the data for 
one person is completed, we press the "Vergelijk"(compare) button. A new web
page appears that contains multiple possibilities from different companies.

From this page, for the top five results we extract premium amount (in Euro),
company name and the premium term (in years) and write them in the excel file.
